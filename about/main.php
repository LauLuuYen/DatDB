    <div class="heading3">About the Project</div>
    <div>
        In this project, we are focus on a scenario in which a college-level class studying consumer informatics is divided into twenty groups of three
students to each produce a report surveying reviews of the new LG G Flex 2 smartphone. We will need to develop a learning environment for this scenario. The learning environment is a web facing database system accessed through a browser. Each group will have its own profile and space on the system. Through this space the group will provide access to its own report and obtain access to the reports of other
groups; upload or submit its assessments of other groupsâ€™ reports; receive assessments of its own report from other groups.
